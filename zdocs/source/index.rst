==============

We at Nook, Nook, and Nook Investment (TM) are excited to bring you Stalkbroker, a
discord bot for tracking you and your friends' turnip prices in Animal Crossing!

Using the Bot
=============

Setting your Timezone
---------------------

Your timezone is important for us to correctly track the prices on your island. It might
be daytime inside stalkbroker's server when it's nighttime on your island!

To let stalkbroker know what timezone you are playing in, type:

.. code-block:: text

    $timezone <your timezone>

Like so:

.. code-block::

    $timezone America/Los_Angeles

Stalkbroker will confirm it heard you with a few reactions!

Timezones names are very a particular, you can find your timezone name
`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones>`_, in the
``'TZ database name'`` column. Try to find the most specific timezone possible, as time
standards are weird and hard, and we wish everyone could just be on ~island time~.

.. note::

    There are three shorthand timezones stalkbroker will recognize:

        * US/Pacific: PST

        * US/Eastern: EST

        * US/Central: CST

    For all other timezones, see the chart referenced above.

Setting Your Current Turnip Price
---------------------------------

Stalkbroker keeps a stalk ticker for your turnip price each week.

To set your current turnip price, use the following command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker 205

We'll add a few reactions to your post to let we know we heard you.

If your bell price is high, the following bulletin will be sent to your server's
bulletin channel:

.. code-block:: text

    The Market Is Moving!!!
    Market: @Billy (Zalack) üçä - Verune
    The Nooks' Offer: 205
    Date: Saturday Apr 24, 2020
    Period: PM
    Memo: 401K through the vegetable way.
    @everyone

.. note::

    The default threshold for sending out a bulletin is a sale price of 200 bells.
    This threshold is configurable by the server admins.

.. note::

    We're smart enough to know that Sunday is the day Daisey Mae comes into town. Your
    price that day will be set as the purchase price automatically!

.. note::

    If you are a member of multiple servers that stalkbroker is also a member of,
    your bulletin will be sent to each server's bulletins channel. That way you only
    need to type your update once and stalkbroker will take care of the rest.

    Stalkbroker CANNOT see servers it is not invited to, so only servers which have
    stalkbroker installed will get these automatic updates!

Setting a Past Turnip Price
---------------------------

Say it's 12:30 PM and (oh no!) you forgot to update your ticker in the morning!
Not to fret! You can type:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker 121 AM

In this case, *a bulletin will not go out to your server*, as it is not a current,
actionable price. The market doesn't move on yesterday's news, as we say. However, it's
still worth setting so you can pull up a more complete ticker later.

If you missed an earlier day, you can also specify a a date:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker 136 4/23 AM

Down the road, stalkbroker will be able to do price projections, and the more complete
your ticker, the more accurate the projections will be!

.. note::

    When setting a price, the price, date, and time of day (AM/PM) can appear in any
    order. All of the following commands are valid:

        * $ticker 136 4/23 AM
        * $ticker 136 AM 4/23
        * $ticker AM 136 4/23
        * $ticker 4/23 AM 136
        * etc, etc

.. note::

    When setting the price for a sunday, Stalkbroker knows this is the the purchase
    price. Additionally, when retroactively setting past price, there is no need to
    include the AM / PM value for a sunday, though including it will not throw an error.


Getting Your Ticker
-------------------

To look up your current week's stalk ticker, just type:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker

Stalkbroker will give you an overview of your market's trends:

.. code-block:: text

    Market Report
    Market: Billy (Zalack) üçä - Verune
    Week Of: 04/19/20
    Daisey'S Deal: 98
    Monday Am: 68
    Monday Pm: 78
    Tuesday Am: 89
    Tuesday Pm: 65
    Wednesday Am: 110
    Wednesday Pm: 115
    Thursday Am: 209
    Thursday Pm: 190
    Friday Am: 180
    Friday Pm: 120
    Memo: Not just another piece of shovelware

To get a ticker for a past week just request a date from that week:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker 4/5

And to get a friend's ticker instead of yours, just tag 'em:

.. code-block:: text

    $ticker @TheRealDarthVader

.. note::

    You *cannot set a price* on a friend's ticker, only view it. Mentions on ticker
    commands with a bell price to update will be executed on *your* stalk ticker.


Installing the Bot
==================

To install the bot, make sure you have permissions to add bots to your server, then
`click this link <https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=700157570513502238&permissions=1342490688&scope=bot>`_.

Congratulations! Your server now has cutting-edge, best-in-class investment support
from Nook, Nook, and Nook Investment.

Configuring the Bot
===================

Bulletin Channel
----------------

To set the channel you want price bulletins to come into, type this in the desired
channel:

.. code-block:: text

    $bulletins here

Bulletin Minimum
----------------

To change the minimum bell price required for bulletins, invoke this command in any
channel:

.. code-block:: text

    $bulletins minimum 310

Now bulletins will only be sent when a sale price is at or above 310 bells.

And that's it! Let's make some bells together.
